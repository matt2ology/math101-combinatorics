## Problem 6

Let $\large X=\left\{1,\:2,\:3,\:4\right\}$. Let $\large \mathcal A$ be the collection of all subsets $\large X$ with an even number of elements, and $\large \mathcal B$ be the collection of all subsets of $\large X$ with an odd number of elements. <br> Remark : The empty set $\large \varnothing$ is one of the sets in $\large \mathcal A$ since it has 0 elements and 0 is even.

(a) List all of the elements of $\large \mathcal A$. (0.5 points)

(b) List all of the elements of $\large \mathcal B$. (0.5 points)

(c) Is the function $\Large f\left(C\right)=X \backslash C$ a bijection from $\Large \mathcal A$ to $\Large \mathcal B$? Recall that $\Large X \backslash C$ that is the complement of $\Large C$ in $\Large X$. (0.25 points)

(b) A list $\Large \mathcal L$ contains 134 elements. Each element $\Large \mathcal L$ is a subset of $\large {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}$. Explain why the list $\Large \mathcal L$ must contain two elements that are the same. (0.5 points)

(c) Suppose it takes a program 1 second to find the determinant of a $\large 2 \times 2$ matrix. If $\large S$ is the set of all $\large 2 \times 2$ matrices of the form $\large \begin{pmatrix}x&y\\ z&t\end{pmatrix}$ where $\Large x,\:y,\:z,\:t\:\in \left\{0,\:1\right\}$, what is the minimum amount of time it would take the program to find the determinant of every matrix in $\large S$?
